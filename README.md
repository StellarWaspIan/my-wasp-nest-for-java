TODAY I LEARNED THAT WHITE CHOCOLATE IS NOT CHOCOLATE AT ALL, my hole life has been a lie.

any way, i started a "project" about calculating the average of 5 numbers given by the user. the operation is made in a function/method (i dont know the difference yet).

almost 7/12/24, i made the thing work. it wasn't working because i forgot to put "name".java to the program, silly me! I WILL go to sleep.

im sooo sleppy eepy deepy.
